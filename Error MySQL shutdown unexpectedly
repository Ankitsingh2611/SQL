Caution: Do not delete the 'ibdata1' file as it may result in the irreversible loss of all your databases.

Instead, first try using the MySQL backup folder which is included with XAMPP. So do next steps:

1. go to C:\xampp\mysql (where Xampp is Installed)

2. Rename folder data to data_old

3. Make a copy of backup  folder and name it as data

4. Copy all your database folders from data_old into data (except mysql, performance_schema, and phpmyadmin folders)

5. Copy data_old/ibdata1 file into data folder

6. Now, Start MySQL from XAMPP control panel
