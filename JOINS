# INNER JOINS - To apply joins there should be a a common attribute in both tables.

#                 left                   right
#                 1                        1
#                 2                        2
#                 3                        3
                
#             result = 1,2,3 of both
            
            
            
# OUTER JOIN
# An outer join returns all records from both tables, with NULL in the columns where there is no match.

#    Left join 
#             left                          right
#             1                              1

#    The following are the most common types of joins:
#    1. INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
#    2. LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from
#    the right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the right side.
#    3. RIGHT JOIN: This is similar to a LEFT JOIN, but returns all records from
#    the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
#    4. FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or
#    right table records.
#    5. CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of rows from two or more tables.
