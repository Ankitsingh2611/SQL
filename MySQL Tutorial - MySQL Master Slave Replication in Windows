Database replication is the frequent electronic copying of data from a database in one computer or server to a database in another. 

In this example, two XAMPP servers are being used.

    Master – Server IP (Ex. 192.168.157.128) for demo I have localhost.
    Slave – Server IP (Ex. 192.168.157.129)Copy
You need to install XAMPP with MySQL server on both master and slave machine or Install Two XAMPP in Same Machine.

PART 1 - In master server

-----------------------------------------------

Step 1. Login to Master Server. 

Edit & Modify the Configuration file of MySql.

#log-bin Configuration in my.ini

log-bin="C:/mysql_master_logs/log-bin.log"

server-id = 1Copy
# bind-address = 127.0.0.1         #comment this line if you want to remotely access your server

Step 2. Restart Mysql Server.

Step 3. Login to Mysql Server.

mysql -u root -pCopy
Step 4.  Create a new user for Replication and specify the Password to that user.

MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER 'mysqlrepli'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin@123';
MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'mysqlrepli'@'localhost';
MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;Copy
/* not using the below code for now. Here I am using one machine for demo.

MariaDB [(none)]> create user 'mysqlrepli'@'192.168.157.128' identified by 'admin@123';

MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'mysqlrepli'@'192.168.157.128';

MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

*/

Example : 

MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER 'replication_user'@'192.168.157.128' IDENTIFIED BY 'replica_password';

MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replication_user '@'192.168.157.128';Copy
Step 5. binary logging

# check binary logging

MariaDB [(none)]> show global variables like 'log_bin';Copy
# View the binary log location

MariaDB [(none)]> show global variables like '%log_bin%';Copy
# Show binary logs

MariaDB [(none)]> show binary logs;Copy
Step 6. Execute below command to Lock Tables & take backup and view the File & Position of Master Server.

MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;Copy
C:/path >mysqldump -u root -p –all-databases –master-data > data.sqlCopy
Note: Path will be mysqldump.exe path.. It will be inside the bin folder.

MariaDB [(none)]> show master status;Copy
+------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| File             | Position | Binlog_Do_DB | Binlog_Ignore_DB |
+------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
| mysql-bin.000001 |    764   |    |                  |
+------------------+----------+--------------+------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)Copy
PART - 2 - In Slave Server

------------------------------------------ 

Step 7. Login to Slave Server. Edit & Modify the Configuration file of MySql Server.

# Find the following line:

bind-address = 127.0.0.1Copy
# Replace it with the following line:

bind-address = Slave-Server-IPCopy
#log-bin Configuration in my.ini

log-bin="C:/mysql_slave_logs/log-bin.log"

server-id = 2

# Restart Mysql ServerCopy
Step 8. Login to Mysql in Slave Server.

# mysql -u root -pCopy
Step 9. Import Data Dump

mysql -u root -p < data.sqlCopy
Step 10. Specify the following details as given below & make sure to Replace the following settings with your settings.

MASTER_HOST     :   IP Address of Master server

MASTER_USER     :   Replication User of Master server that we had created in previous steps.

MASTER_PASSWORD :   Replication User Password of Master server that we had created in previous steps.

MASTER_LOG_FILE :   Your Value of Master Log File of Master server.

MASTER_LOG_POS  :   Your Value of Master Log Position of Master server.

MariaDB [(none)]> STOP SLAVE; 

MariaDB [(none)]>  CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST = 'localhost', MASTER_USER = 'mysqlrepli', MASTER_PASSWORD = 'admin@123', MASTER_LOG_FILE = 'mysql-bin.000001', MASTER_LOG_POS = 420;

MariaDB [(none)]>  START SLAVE;Copy
MariaDB [(none)]>  show databases;Copy
MariaDB [(none)]>  SHOW SLAVE STATUS;Copy
### Don’t forget to unlock the tables.

MariaDB [(none)]>  UNLOCK TABLES;Copy
PART - 3 - Testing for replication work

-------------------------------------------------------------

Step 10. Login to Master Server. Login to Mysql Server

# mysql -u root -pCopy
Step 11. For testing a Replication we need to create a new database, it will automatically replicate on Slave Server.

MariaDB [(none)]>   create database chiragdb;Copy
Step 12. Login to Slave Server. Login to Mysql Server

# mysql -u root -pCopy
Step 13. View your Replicated Database  by using below command.

MariaDB [(none)]>   show databases;
